"""
This is a multi-line comment.
Sometimes we need to use functions that aren't part of the standard Python.
In that case, we import functions from other packages. For our purposes, we
will often use numpy and scipy. The next line imports the scipy package, but
gives it the shorthand name 'sp'. When we import a package this way, we have to
preface all functions from that package with 'sp'.

import scipy as sp

# The random() function from scipy's random package will allow us to draw 
#   pseudorandom numbers from between 0 and 1. 
print(sp.random.random(3))
